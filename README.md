TASK:
Q_Sequence.py -> program that calculate the Hofstadter's Q-Sequence, failed test 5 and test 6.

Hofstadter's Q-Sequence is a sequence of numbers where every integer above zero has a corresponding
q-sequence value. You can determine the q-sequence value from a formula that tells you how far back 
in the sequence to go and add two values together. The first two values of the sequence are 
Q(1) = 1 and Q(2) = 1, and every number above 2 can be expressed according to the 
following formula (where n is your input value): Q(n) = Q(n - Q(n - 1)) + Q(n - Q(n -2))
 
Task: 
Given an integer value input, determine and output the corresponding q-sequence value.

Input Format: 
A positive integer value.

Output Format: 
A positive integer value that represents the value in the q-sequence that the input holds.

Sample Input: 
5

Sample Output: 
3
